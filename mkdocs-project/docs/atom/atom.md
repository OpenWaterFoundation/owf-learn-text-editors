## Overview

The free open source `Atom` editor from GitHub provides a good general editor for Windows and Mac (Linux?)
and as expected has Git/GitHub integration for version control.
It also provides a built-in Markdown viewer.

## Resources

* [Atom home page](https://atom.io/)

## Use

The following are useful examples:

* To view the rendered version of a Markdown file,
first open the Markdown file for editing and then use the key combination:  ***Ctrl-Shift-m***.
A second tab will be shown with rendered Markdown.
	+ Edits to the original Markdown content will cause the rendered version to update.
	+ Internal links in the Markdown, when clicked on, will not reposition the rendered page
	It is unclear if this is a feature that will be added.
	+ Links to external web pages can be tested by using ***Ctrl-left-click*** on the link.
	The page should open in the default web browser.
